# Computer-Networks-Application-NS3-and-Transport-Layer

This repository contains a deep and detailed implementation of a variety of Network Application and Transport Layer features and solves multiple daily life tasks associated with these layers. 

**NS-3 is used for detailed simulations for packet transfer across the Application and Transport Layer with Wireshark being the main tool for the packet capture.**

Multiple project deployment screenshots with output and packet captured files have stored associated with the code files pertaining to a host of tasks.
Extensive graph plotting for NS-3 simulation is done using **gnuplot**.

Refer to **Project Description.pdf** to understand the various tasks assigned to the Application, NS-3 Simulation and Transport Layer.

#### Refer to the Reports of each task in the respective directories. 
They give a detailed overview of the tasks solved with screenshots giving a demonstrative explanation

Output files in **XML** have also been attached showing a full deployment of the project on the local machine.

**PCAPNG files** have been attached in the respective directories to show the Wireshark Capture for the Project Tasks.
